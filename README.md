Qt/QML GUI for BitsharesX

This is a QML GUI for the Bitshares X exchange. At present, it is incomplete, lacking some key features such as logging in, but it should provide a solid starting point as nearly all of the UI design is in place.

Note that at present, no integration between the GUI and the Bitshares X project has been implemented. The GUI communicates with C++ adapter classes, which will later interface with the real backend.
